Use the appropriate data structure for it's purpose.  A growing and shrinking data structure should use an ArrayList instead of an array.
Don't limit your object by placing restrictions on it that don't break your code.  Someone may want to use empty strings, null values or negatives for names/suits/values etc.
addCard should throw an exception when a null card is attempted to be added
Reuse your methods (addCard) to reduce code and create a more streamlined version.  Would also reduce number of exceptions.
Don't throw exceptions that will already happen for you (discardPile == null for example)
Avoid using methods that are not backwards compatible (isBlank vs isEmpty).  Can be good but can also be bad to use the latest thing!
Otherwise great work!
